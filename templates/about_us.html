    <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> About This Project</h2>
    <p>The Face Emotion Detection System is designed to enhance lecture quality by providing real-time feedback on student emotions during classes.</p>
    <p>Teachers use this tool to understand how students respond to lessons, adjusting content to improve engagement without needing to focus on the software itself.</p>
    <p>Built with Flask, FER, OpenCV, and PostgreSQL, itâ€™s a simple yet effective solution deployed on Render, developed by students at MIT ADT University, Pune.</p>
